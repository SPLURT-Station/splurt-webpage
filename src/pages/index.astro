						What is S.P.L.U.R.T. Station?
					</h2>

					<p class="mb-4 lg:mb-6">
						S.P.L.U.R.T. Station is a multiplayer sandbox game in which you can
						roleplay as your own character and engage in roleplay with other
						people's characters. In the year 2565, the megacorporation
						Nanotrasen employs you as a staff member onboard their latest
						state-of-the-art research station. Nanotrasen claims to be
						researching plasma, a mysterious substance, but soon you'll find out
						this station is about much more than just research~ At the start of
						each round, players are assigned roles ranging from scientists and
						doctors to engineers and captains.
					</p>
					<p>
						S.P.L.U.R.T. Station offers the full Space Station 13 experience
						with an additional focus on lewd and sexual content and
						interactions. Beyond the standard SS13 gameplay of research, medical
						simulation, and player-driven stories, we provide a safe, consensual
						environment for adult furry roleplay where every round tells a
						unique story.
